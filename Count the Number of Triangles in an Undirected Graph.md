# Ex. No: 18E - Count the Number of Triangles in an Undirected Graph

## AIM:
To write a Python program to **count the number of triangles** present in an **undirected graph** using matrix operations.

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Initialize a matrix `aux2` to store the square of the adjacency matrix (i.e., `graph²`).  
Also, initialize a matrix `aux3` to store the cube of the adjacency matrix (i.e., `graph³`).

**Step 2**: Multiply the adjacency matrix with itself to compute `aux2 = graph × graph`.

**Step 3**: Multiply `aux2` with the adjacency matrix again to compute `aux3 = aux2 × graph`.

**Step 4**: Compute the **trace** of the matrix `aux3` (i.e., the sum of diagonal elements of the matrix).

**Step 5**: Divide the trace by **6** to get the number of triangles in the graph.  
*(Each triangle is counted six times in the trace — twice per vertex and once per direction.)*

**Step 6**: Return the result.
